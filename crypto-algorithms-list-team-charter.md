# SPDX Cryptographic Algorithms List (Criptography) Team Charter

## Introduction

The SPDX Cryptographic (Crypto) Algorithms List Team was formed to create and maintain a standardized, community-curated list of cryptographic algorithms, following the successful model of the SPDX License List. This list provides a shared, unambiguous vocabulary for identifying and referencing cryptographic algorithms in Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), SPDX documents, and related tooling.

## Vision

To enable greater software transparency, auditability, and compliance by establishing a trusted, openly governed, standardized registry of cryptographic algorithms for global reuse.

## Mission

The SPDX Cryptographic Algorithms List Team develops and maintains a high-quality, comprehensive, machine-readable, and SPDX-aligned registry of cryptographic algorithms that can be reliably referenced across tooling, SBOMs, policies, and standards. We provide the software and cryptography communities with standardized identifiers and metadata, essential for cryptographic declaration, inventory, compliance, and security analysis.

## Strategic Goal

The SPDX Crypto Algorithms List Team aims to build and maintain a canonical list of cryptographic algorithms using widely accepted identifiers and metadata. The team supports the SPDX project by aligning the list’s format and structure with current and future SPDX specifications; fostering collaboration and interoperability with existing standards bodies and open source communities; and promoting adoption of the list and its identifiers across the software ecosystem.

## Get Involved

The SPDX Crypto Algorithms List Team operates under the SPDX project's open governance and contribution principles, encouraging broad participation. We welcome all contributors, especially individuals and organizations with interest or expertise in cryptography, software transparency, SBOM tooling, licensing, and open standards.

Join our regular meetings, contribute to our GitHub repository at https://github.com/spdx/crypto-algorithms, or connect with us through the SPDX community channels. Whether you bring deep cryptographic expertise, practical implementation experience, or user perspective, your contribution helps build the foundation for higher levels of transparency in software supply chains.
